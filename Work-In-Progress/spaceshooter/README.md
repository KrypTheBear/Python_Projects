## Introduction:

This is a little project I had in mind to learn more about Python and to get closer to the pygame library.
It's more or less your typical 2D-Sidescrolling space shooter. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Yet.

## Common abbreviations:

et = Enemy Type

dmg = Damage

prj = Projectile

l, r, u, d = Left, Right, Up, Down, works in combinations (l/r | u/d)
